**# Streamline Your DAO with Optimistic Governance**

Welcome to the future of DAO governance! This repository empowers you to implement Optimistic Governance, a powerful framework designed to expedite decision-making and streamline your DAO's operations.

## âš¡ What is Optimistic Governance?

Imagine a DAO where trusted members, the **Optimistic Council**, propose changes and swiftly enact them. Yet, the broader community retains control through a **veto mechanism**. This enables:

* **Rapid decision-making:** Proposals move quickly, allowing your DAO to adapt and innovate with agility.
* **Community control:** Veto power ensures proposals align with your DAO's vision and values.
* **Reduced bureaucracy:** Streamlined processes minimize overhead, keeping your DAO lean and efficient.

##  How does it work?

Optimistic Governance leverages a combination of battle-tested smart contracts:

* **Council NFTs:** Grant membership in the Optimistic Council.
* **Voting Tokens:** Determine voting power for vetoes.
* **Optimistic Governor:** Handles proposals and their swift execution.
* **Veto Governor:** Allows the community to challenge and potentially veto proposals.
* **Timelock:** Holds DAO assets and ensures proposals undergo a review period before execution.

##  Key features:

* **Super Quorum:** Voting ends upon majority approval, accelerating the process.
* **Proposer & Canceller Roles:** The Optimistic Governor proposes changes, while the Veto Governor can cancel them within a defined timeframe.
* **Seamless Tally Integration:** Connect the Veto Governor to the Optimistic Governor within Tally's user-friendly interface.
