**# Streamline Your DAO with Optimistic Governance**

Welcome to the future of DAO governance! This repository empowers you to implement Optimistic Governance, a powerful framework designed to expedite decision-making and streamline your DAO's operations.

Launch a Optimistic Governance with Tally:** [[https://docs.tally.xyz/premium-features/optimistic-governance](https://docs.tally.xyz/premium-features/optimistic-governance)]


## ‚ö° What is Optimistic Governance?

Imagine a DAO where trusted members, the **Optimistic Council**, propose changes and swiftly enact them. Yet, the broader community retains control through a **veto mechanism**. This enables:

* **Rapid decision-making:** Proposals move quickly, allowing your DAO to adapt and innovate with agility.
* **Community control:** Veto power ensures proposals align with your DAO's vision and values.
* **Reduced bureaucracy:** Streamlined processes minimize overhead, keeping your DAO lean and efficient.

##  How does it work?

Optimistic Governance leverages a combination of battle-tested smart contracts:

* **Council NFTs:** Grant membership in the Optimistic Council.
* **Voting Tokens:** Determine voting power for vetoes.
* **Optimistic Governor:** Handles proposals and their swift execution.
* **Veto Governor:** Allows the community to challenge and potentially veto proposals.
* **Timelock:** Holds DAO assets and ensures proposals undergo a review period before execution.

## üíª Getting Started

#### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/withtally/gov_deployer.git && cd gov_deployer && git checkout new
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in the necessary values in the .env file (e.g., node RPCs)
# You can also set all the values 
# npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY
```

Some other commands

```bash
pnpm clean
pnpm test
npx hardhat compile
```

It also adds the whole contracts added and their verify lines to a file called `contracts.out`, for future reference so you can close your terminal with no worries.

#### Pre-Requisites

- Node.js and PNPM
- Git

#### Deploying

The configuration parameters to deploy the contracts can be found at `deploy.config` in the root of this folder.

```bash
# you have to define the network according to network name listed in hardhat.config.ts
pnpm deployc --network sepolia
# to test in hardhat just run
pnpm deployc
```

#### Validating Contract
After running the script to deploy the contract, it will print the command lines needed to validate each contract in your terminal. 

But to run those contracts you must have provided your Etherscan ( or other scan ) to the API KEY in the `.env` file, you can use it to validate the contracts.

Example output:

```bash
quorum numerator: 30 
vote extension: 7200
